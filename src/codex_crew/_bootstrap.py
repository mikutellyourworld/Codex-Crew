"""Console-script entry that self-heals a stale editable install.

``codexcrew`` is often run from a git checkout (``pip install -e .``). A plain
``git pull`` never re-runs dependency resolution, so a commit that adds a
runtime dependency leaves every subsequent CLI invocation dying at import
time with a raw ``ModuleNotFoundError`` traceback — for a state the tool can
repair itself. Release installs are unaffected (pip resolves
``install_requires`` at install time) and ``codexcrew update`` already re-runs
``pip install -e .``; this closes the git-pull gap.

This module is the console-script entry point
(``codexcrew = codex_crew._bootstrap:main``). It imports the real CLI and, on
``ModuleNotFoundError`` from a source checkout, installs the checkout's
declared dependencies once and retries the import in-process. A failed import
is side-effect-free (Python evicts the failing module from ``sys.modules``),
so the retry needs no re-exec — which also sidesteps the POSIX/Windows
``execv`` divergence. HOW the install runs is
:func:`codex_crew.dep_sync.sync_or_reinstall`'s decision: an editable
reinstall where pip can replace the console script, and a dependency-only
install where it cannot — which on Windows is always, since this process was
launched through the very ``codexcrew.exe`` a reinstall would have to rewrite.
That is why the heal now runs there instead of printing a manual one-liner: a
dependency install never touches that wrapper, and a missing dependency is
precisely what brought us here.

Everything imported here MUST be stdlib: this module runs BEFORE the
package's dependencies are known to exist. ``codex_crew.dep_sync`` is the one
package import it makes, and counts as stdlib for this purpose because it is
required to stay stdlib-only — it imports nothing else, so it cannot raise the
very error being healed, and a test asserts that. Output MUST stay
ASCII-only — it prints before ``platform_compat.ensure_utf8_console()`` has
run, so non-ASCII would UnicodeEncodeError on Windows cp1252 pipes.
