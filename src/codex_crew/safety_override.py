"""Time-limited safety override — replaces permanent YOLO mode.

Provides a ``SafetyOverride`` class with two kinds of grant:

- **Ad-hoc** — YOLO toggled mid-session from Slack, the dashboard picker or the
  API. Bounded by ONE duration shared by every surface (``agent.yolo_duration``,
  default 6 h, hard ceiling 24 h) and automatically expires. A 5-minute grace
  window after expiry allows renew() to reactivate without a full
  re-activation flow.
- **Declared** — ``agent.dangerously_skip_permissions: true`` in operator-owned
  config (the camelCase and legacy ``yolo`` spellings are also read). A standing
  instruction, so it does NOT expire: it is re-established and re-audited on
  every startup (state is in-memory), cleared the moment the operator picks
  another approval mode, and deniable by the enterprise governance ceiling via
  the ``yolo_duration`` scope's ``permanent`` member — which downgrades it to the
  ad-hoc duration.

Per-surface TTLs (30 min Slack / 6 h dashboard / 24 h config) were removed: the
same operator re-enabling the same grant got a different lifetime depending on
where they clicked, which was unpredictable without buying any security.

All state changes are logged to the Security Event Log (SEL).

#
# A grant lives in memory only, so a restart ends it. That is the DESIGNED
# behaviour and this module does not change it -- what it changes is that the
# ending used to be SILENT: an operator who granted six hours of auto-approval,
# then restarted the gateway an hour later, got no reply telling them the
# remaining five hours were gone. The next unattended run simply stopped and
# waited for an approval nobody was watching for.
#
# So the file below records that a grant WAS live, never that it may resume. It
# holds the wall-clock deadline (the in-memory deadlines are
# ``time.monotonic()``, which means nothing to another process), the source, and
# whether the grant had an expiry at all. Startup reads it once, tells the
# operator when a TIMED grant still had time left, and deletes it.
#
# It is deliberately NOT signed, and that follows from what it can do: the file
# confers no authority, so the worst a forged one achieves is a spurious "your
# override was dropped" notice. A restored GRANT would need signing -- and a
# planned-vs-crash discriminator this codebase does not have -- which is exactly
# why restoring one is not what this does.
#
# One record per data home is correct, not a shared-state hazard: the file lives
# in ``config_dir()``, which is the very directory ``gateway_lock`` holds an
# exclusive advisory flock on for a gateway's whole lifetime, and a second
# gateway on the same home is REFUSED at startup rather than allowed to race
# (see gateway_lock's module docstring -- the invariant exists because shared-home
# writers clobber ``sessions/*.jsonl``). So there is never a sibling gateway to
# consume this record out from under the one that wrote it.

#
# * ``is_active()`` is the auto-approve predicate every transport passes to

#   so it runs per TOOL CALL.
# * arming reaches this module from the event loop through synchronous callers
#   (``taskrunner._grant_run_trust``, the Slack slash handlers).
#
# So there are two forms, and which one a caller wants follows from its frequency:
#
# * ``yolo_policy_permits()`` -- pure memory, for the per-tool-call predicate. Hands
#   a stale value back while a refresh runs on a worker thread. Staleness is bounded
#   by the TTL *within one ceiling*; across a ceiling CHANGE the TTL says nothing, so
#   the entry carries the governance generation it was resolved under and a newly
#   installed ceiling EXPIRES it at once rather than letting a permit primed under
#   the previous policy live out the remaining TTL.
# * ``_resolve_yolo_policy_blocking()`` -- authoritative, for ARMING. A deliberate,
#   rare act should not be decided by a value up to a TTL old, and arming already
#   does filesystem I/O for its fail-closed audit. Its async callers offload it.

#: thread: arming offloads it via ``asyncio.to_thread``, and the off-loop refresh
#: scheduled by ``yolo_policy_verdict`` runs it in another worker. Interleaved, one
#: caller's post-read sample can straddle the other's store, so a stamp is written
#: for a generation the resolve did not actually observe -- and the next reader then
#: either serves a verdict resolved under a different ceiling, or (with the entry
#: left un-stamped) reads UNKNOWN and fails closed on a grant that was just armed
#: successfully. Under parallel load that surfaced as a yolo arm being honoured in
#: one run and refused in the next.
#:
#: Held ACROSS the governance read, deliberately. Serialising concurrent resolves is
#: the point: the second caller waits and then finds a fresh entry, rather than
#: duplicating the same filesystem walk and racing to store it. Never taken on the
#: event loop -- every caller of this function is already off-loop or a sync CLI/test

#: -- an NTP step, a VM restore, an operator correcting the clock -- and a backwards
#: jump makes ``now - resolved_at`` negative, so the entry reads as fresh and the TTL

#: a policy tightening would stop landing at all. A test suite hits it immediately
#: (a fresh loop per test); the gateway hits it on any loop replacement.

    own site -- gate at arming, then key the cache to the governance generation,
    then move the resolve off the loop -- and the next round found another way in,
    because a boolean cannot express the state that actually causes it. "I have

    not "policy forbids this" either. Collapsing it onto either one is what kept

    * collapse UNKNOWN onto PERMITTED and a stale ``True`` auto-approves every
      tool -- the finding, in three different disguises. The last one needed no
      exotic timing at all: ``_resolve_yolo_policy_blocking`` returns without
      restamping when the resolve raises, so a persistently failing resolve served
      the old permit indefinitely.
    * collapse UNKNOWN onto DENIED and ``is_active`` revokes -- permanently, by
      design -- on a window that opens on EVERY ceiling install, including ones
      that still permit YOLO. That destroys live grants on unrelated refreshes.

    So UNKNOWN is returned as itself and each caller collapses it in the direction
    that is safe for what IT decides: approval fails closed (see
    ``yolo_policy_permits``), revocation does not fire (see ``is_active``).

    UNKNOWN is exactly "the entry was not resolved under the ceiling now
    installed", which is decidable from memory because
    ``_resolve_yolo_policy_blocking`` stamps the generation ONLY on a successful
