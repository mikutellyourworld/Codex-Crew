"""Enforcement of the ``approval_modes`` policy at every ``yolo`` arming surface.

``test_approval_modes_governance.py`` pins the *predicate*
(``approval_mode_permitted`` reading the boot-frozen ceiling). This module pins the
places that must CONSULT it, because a mode the policy denies is only actually off
if every path that can arm it -- and every path that HONOURS an existing grant --
refuses:

* ``POST /api/chat/mode`` -- the explicit session-mode switch (403, no mutation).
* ``safety_override`` arming -- session-wide and scoped.
* ``is_active`` / ``is_scope_active`` / ``renew_scoped`` -- the consult points that
  honour a LIVE grant, so a mid-session deny revokes rather than waiting for a TTL.

The scope governs ``yolo`` only. ``trust`` / ``trust_reads`` are non-deniable (a
policy naming them is refused at parse time), because their consumption predicates
are not gated -- so there is deliberately nothing here asserting Trust enforcement.

Every refusal must also be SEL-audited: a governance denial that leaves no trace is
indistinguishable from the request never having been made, which is exactly the
record an operator needs after an attempted escalation.
