"""The traversal passes' SUBJECT when the scanned input is Python source.

``is_sensitive_source_body`` hands passes 4 and 5 the command strings a body
CONTAINS rather than the body itself. Those two walk shell structure under a
fail-closed budget, and a document is not shell structure: stages split on newline,
so every line of Python counts as a pipeline stage and a few hundred lines exhaust
``_ALT_MAX_STAGES`` while carrying no shell at all -- which refused an ordinary
script for its LENGTH, on every fire.

These tests pin all three directions: the length ceiling is gone, the shell command
line keeps it exactly, and a traversal that hides in a literal is still caught.
