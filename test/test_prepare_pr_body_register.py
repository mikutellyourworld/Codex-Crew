"""The PR body has to read as plain language, and the rule has to stay anchored.

`prepare-pr` writes the PR description, and its "What changed" section is what a
reviewer reads first. Left unconstrained it grows into layered clauses and
decorative jargon that hide the actual change. The skill now pins that prose to
the Age 10 row of the `explain-for` skill.

Two joints can break silently. The register rule can be dropped from
`prepare-pr` (bodies drift back to dense prose with no test failing), or the
`explain-for` row it points at can be renamed away (the reference still reads
fine but resolves to nothing). One assertion each.
