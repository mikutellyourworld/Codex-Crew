"""Relative traversal roots resolve against the command's own ``cd``, never the gateway's cwd.

The structure passes of the bash gate (alternate traversal, ``find`` traversal) used
to resolve a relative root such as ``.`` against this process's working directory.
The agent's shell does not run there, and the desktop app's gateway runs from ``/``,
which holds every fenced store, so every ``grep -r X .`` was refused whatever ``cd``
preceded it. Each "allowed" assertion here runs with the process cwd pinned to a
directory that DOES hold a fenced store, so it fails on the old resolution; each
"denied" assertion keeps the real catches in place.
